# Spherical-Properties
The Sphere Properties Calculator is a simple Python program that allows users to explore and calculate various properties of a sphere based on its radius. This educational tool provides insights into the fundamental characteristics of spheres and how they relate to real-world objects.


The code begins by importing the math module, which provides functions for various mathematical operations.

The user is prompted to enter the radius of the sphere using the input() function. The radius is a measure of the distance from the center of the sphere to its surface. This value is then stored as a floating-point number in the radius variable.

The code then proceeds to compute different properties of the sphere using the provided radius.

Diameter Calculation:

The diameter of the sphere is calculated by multiplying the radius by 2. This value represents the distance across the sphere, passing through its center. The result is stored in the diameter variable.
Circumference Calculation:

The circumference of the sphere is calculated by using the formula: "circumference = diameter × π", where π (pi) is a mathematical constant (approximately 3.14159). The circumference is the length around the sphere's outer boundary or "equator." The result is stored in the circumference variable.
Surface Area Calculation:

The surface area of the sphere is calculated by using the formula: "surface area = 4 × π × radius^2". This value represents the total area of the sphere's curved surface. The result is stored in the surfaceArea variable.
Volume Calculation:

The volume of the sphere is calculated by using the formula: "volume = (4/3) × π × radius^3". This value represents the amount of space enclosed by the sphere. The result is stored in the volume variable.
Displaying Results:

Finally, the calculated values are displayed to the user using the print() function. Each line of output includes a label (e.g., "Diameter:") followed by the corresponding calculated value (e.g., the value of the diameter variable). This provides the user with information about the sphere's diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume.
In summary, this code takes user input for the radius of a sphere, and then calculates and presents its key properties, including diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume. The mathematical formulas are expressed in words to provide a clear understanding of how each property is computed.
